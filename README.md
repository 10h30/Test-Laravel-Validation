## Test Your Laravel Validation Skills

This repository is a test for you: perform a set of tasks listed below, and fix the PHPUnit tests, which are currently intentionally failing.

To test if all the functions work correctly, there are PHPUnit tests in `tests/Feature/ValidationTest.php` file.

In the very beginning, if you run `php artisan test`, or `vendor/bin/phpunit`, all tests fail.
Your task is to make those tests pass.

## How to Submit Your Solution

If you want to submit your solution, you should make a Pull Request to the `main` branch.
It will automatically run the tests via GitHub Actions and will show you/me if the test pass.

If you don't know how to make a Pull Request, [here's my video with instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEcT6JIFji0).

This task is mostly self-served, so I'm not planning review or merge the Pull Requests. This test is for yourselves to assess your skills, the automated tests will be your answer if you passed the test :)


## Questions / Problems?

If you're struggling with some tasks, or you have suggestions how to improve the task, create a GitHub Issue.

Good luck!
